# GCOverrides
##### [Garmin Connect Overrides](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO) - local bugfixes and enhancements of [Garmin Connect Web](https://connect.garmin.com/) 
The Chrome browser allows the user to override the look, the behaviour, and even (to certain extent) the functionality of a remote website. GCOverrides take the advantage of this Chrome feature, and try to fix some known bugs of the Garmin Connect Web application, adding also some supplementary functionality not available in the original version.

*The overrides have no ability to communicate directly with the Garmin device. They can only influence the way the data from Garmin Connect is being presented to the local user of the given Chrome instance.*

## Current Features (v1.17)
* **Activity Overlays bugfix** - adds missing overlays, their labels and titles, on zoomed graphs on the Activity pages
* **Bugfix of Floors per Minute** - the value on the detailed page of a Floor Climbing activity needs to be devided by 60 to show the true pace
* **Custom Sleep Goal** - the default fixed 8h sleep goal can be now adjusted in the [GCO Settings](#Settings)
* **Conversion of Calories to kilojoules** on the Calories In/Out page and on the Dashboard; needs to be enabled in the [GCO Settings](#Settings)
* **Adjustable Y-axis on Graphs** - turns the majority of graphs to have adjustable Y-Axis (with the help of selecting a rectangle of the current graph). Please note, that due to the compression of JavaScript files and the use of numeric chunks in GC, this feature may require frequent updates, and/or may not work for everyone. Searching for a more stable hack.
* **Panning of Graphs** - the user can press the Shift key and drag the mouse in order to pan a zoomed graph (same limitations as at the previous feature)
* **Exportable Graphs** - additional Export menu at zoomed graphs allowing the export of graphs as images or PDF
* **Enhanced Graph Tooltips** - Distance added to all time-based activity graph tootips; improved formatting of tooltips on zoomed versions
* **Hiding Golf** - optional hiding of Golf from the Side Menu and from the Gear Menu; needs to be enabled in the [GCO Settings](#Settings)
* **Hiding Model-Based Badges** - badges designed only for exclusive watches may be hidden from the list of available badges ([configurable](#Settings))
* **Enabling manual date input in Reports** - in the native version, on the Progress Summary page of Reports, the date can only be picked from the Calendar. Now you can enter it manually.
* **Diving Distance** - information about the direct distance between the entry and the exit locations of a dive
* **Detailed 6 Months and Yearly Graphs** - instead of the default monthly averages, all data is shown on most 6 Months and 1 Year reports
* **Step Counts for Activities** - onn the pages of activities of the type Run and Walk, the count of steps done during the activity is displayed
* ... more to come

## Retired Features
* **Weight - 6 Months Report** - after the revamp of the Weight pages in Garmin Connect Web, the 6 months report stopped working and is also no more necessary

For details, please have a look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt)

## Prerequisites
* **Garmin Connect account** - typically a Garmin Connect user also owns a Garmin device (usually a smart watch), though there are people using GC without owning a Garmin device, importing data from devices of other brands.
* **Chrome Browser** - you need to own a recent version of the Chrome browser, supporting the local overrides (available since ~2018)

## Installation
1. Download the [master.zip](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO/archive/master.zip)
1. Unzip it into your Documents folder, on the desktop, or into another location of your choice
1. In Chrome, hit the key combination **Ctrl+Shift+i** (on Windows) to launch the **DevTools**, or do so through the Chrome menu
1. Go to the **Sources** tab of the DevTools pane or window
1. Click **Overrides** in the top-left of DevTools (It might be behind the **Â»** menu)
1. Click **Select folder for overrides** and choose the folder **GCO-master** in the location you used for unzipping the installtion package
1. Click **Allow** on the pop-up bar at the top of DevTools that will appear!
1. Verify that the checkbox **Enable Local Overrides** in the bar above the folder name is checked
1. Detach and minimize the DevTools pane, or go back to the Chrome browser and load (or reload) the Garmin Connect website. If you see, at the center of the top of the website, a gray label **GCOverrides**, the installation was successfull, and the bugfixes and additional features of GCO shoud be active

**Note:** The DevTools pane **must stay open** to keep the Local Overrides working. You can detach the DevTools pane from the browser, and minimize it (see the context menu under the tripple dot symbol in the upper right corner of the DevTools for the detachment option). Keep also on mind, that the DevTools are only active on the browser tab, where they were started. If you open another tab with Garmin Connect, you need to start the DevTools with Ctrl+Shift+i on that tab, too.

## Settings
Some GCO features allow the user to customize certain parameters. Since the version 0.05, it is for example the sleeping goal. Since GCO has no access to your device, to your disk, or to your GC account settings, the custom settings need to be stored in one of the override files. For editing the parameters, please open the override folder **GCO-master** and navigate to the file **GCO-master\sso.garmin.com\sso\js\gauth-widget.js**. Open the file in the DevTools pane, or in a text editor, like for example the Notepad, search the section "GCOverrides SETTINGS", and edit the values to adjust the parameters.

Many parameters take the values 'false' or 'true' only. The parameter 'gcoHideBadges' contains a list of several international variants of the word 'watch' for excluding the watch-based models from the available list. Add your own translation (if not included yet), or any addtional keywords from the description of badges you want to exclude. Keep the parameter 'gcoHideBadges' empty, if you do not wish to hide any available badges.

**Important:** Please note that the assignment of the value **must end with a semicolon**! Accidental deleting of the semicolon would prevent the override script from working.

## Updates
Updates do **not** happen automatically. When you encounter a problem, or want to use a new functionality, please download and the up-to-date [master.zip](https://github.com/truxoft/GCO/archive/master.zip). Unzip it into the same folder as the older version. Before unzipping the master.zip, please remove the old GCO-master folder. No other operations are needed.

Please note, that after reloading the GCOverride files, your cusomized [GCO Settings](#Settings) will be overwritten and have to be adjusted again!  

## FAQ
* currently no questions were asked

## Future Plans
There are plans for adding a number of other bugfixes and enhancements, but there is currently no schedule. Some features may be removed
in future, if the functionality of the original website no more requires the override, or when the override stops functioning due to the changes on the website. 

## Wish List
Some of the following wishes may be implemented in future, but some may be complicated or impossible to develop with the currently available means.
* HR Zones overlays on activity graphs
* Assign gear by sport subcategory
* Graphs and averages for a selected lap of an activity
* Averages and totals for a selection of an activity graph
* Configurable default Elevation Correction
* Center Courses map to the current detected location
